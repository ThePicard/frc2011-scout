SCOUT
=====

I wrote this as a scouter for the 2011 FRC season. I never quite finished the
individual team or match views, only the insert and list views. Those were the
most important, as we primarily wanted to see the best teams.

To build you will need GTK+ and sqlite3 development headers. For debian based
systems:
apt-get install libgtk2.0-dev libsqlite3-dev

The build command would then be:
gcc -o scout scout.c `pkg-config --libs --cflags gtk+-2.0 sqlite3 gmodule-2.0`

scout searches only the current directory for scout.glade, so you kind have to
take that wherever you use scout. Or change the path in scout.c ;)
